# IOpipe Analytics & Distributed Tracing Agent for Python

This package provides analytics and distributed tracing for event-driven applications running on AWS Lambda.

## Installation

We expect you will import this library into an existing (or new) Python project intended to be run on AWS Lambda.  On Lambda, functions are expected to include module dependencies within their project paths, thus we use `-t $PWD`. Users building projects with a requirements.txt file may simply add `iopipe` to their dependencies.

From your project directory:

```bash
$ pip install iopipe -t .

# If running locally or in other environments _besides_ AWS Lambda:
$ pip install requests -t .
```

Your folder structure for the function should look similar to:

```
index.py # contains your lambda handler
  /iopipe
    - __init__.py
    - iopipe.py
  /requests
    - __init__.py
    - api.py
    - ...
```

Installation of the requests library is necessary for local dev/test, but not when running on AWS Lambda as this library is part of the default environment via the botocore library.

More details about lambda deployments are available in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html).

## Basic Usage

Simply use our decorator to report metrics:

```python
from iopipe import IOpipe

iopipe = IOpipe("your project token here")

@iopipe
def handler(event, context):
  pass
```

## Configuration

The following may be set as kwargs to the IOpipe class initializer:

#### `token` (string: required)

Your IOpipe project token. If not supplied, the environment variable `$IOPIPE_TOKEN` will be used if present. [Find your project token](https://dashboard.iopipe.com/install)

#### `debug` (bool: optional = False)

Debug mode will log all data sent to IOpipe servers. This is also a good way to evaluate the sort of data that IOpipe is receiving from your application. If not supplied, the environment variable `IOPIPE_DEBUG` will be used if present.

#### `enabled` (bool: optional = True)

Conditionally enable/disable the agent. For example, you will likely want to disabled the agent during development. The environment variable `$IOPIPE_ENABLED` will also be checked.

#### `timeout_window` (float|int: optional = 0.5)

By default, IOpipe will capture timeouts by exiting your function 0.5 seconds early from the AWS configured timeout, to allow time for reporting. You can disable this feature by setting `timeout_window` to `0` in your configuration. If not supplied, the environment variable `$IOPIPE_TIMEOUT_WINDOW` will be used if present.

### Reporting Exceptions

The IOpipe decorator will automatically catch, trace and reraise any uncaught exceptions in your function. If you want to trace exceptions raised in your case, you can use the `.error(exception)` method. This will add the exception to the current report.

```python
from iopipe import IOpipe

iopipe = IOpipe()

# Example 1: uncaught exceptions

@iopipe
def handler(event, context):
  raise Exception('This exception will be added to the IOpipe report automatically')

# Example 2: caught exceptions

@iopipe
def handler(event, context):
  try:
    raise Exception('This exception is being caught by your function')
  except Exception as e:
    # Makes sure the exception is added to the report
    iopipe.error(e)
```

It is important to note that a report is sent to IOpipe when `error()` is called. So you should only record exceptions this way for failure states. For caught exceptions that are not a failure state, it is recommended to use custom metrics (see below).

### Custom Metrics

You can log custom values in the data sent upstream to IOpipe using the following syntax:

```python
from iopipe import IOpipe

iopipe = IOpipe()

@iopipe
def handler(event, context):
  # the name of the metric must be a string
  # numerical (int, long, float) and string types supported for values
  iopipe.log("my_metric", 42)
```

This makes it easy to add custom data and telemetry within your function.

## Framework Integration

### Chalice

Using IOpipe with the [Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice) framework is easy. Just wrap your `app` like so:

```python
from chalice import Chalice
from iopipe import IOpipe

iopipe = IOpipe()

app = Chalice(app_name='helloworld')

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

# Do this after defining your routes
app = iopipe(app)
```

### Zappa

Using IOpipe with [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) is easy. In your project add the following:

```python
from iopipe import IOpipe
from zappa.handler import lambda_handler

iopipe = IOpipe()
lambda_handler = iopipe(lambda_handler)
```

Then in your `zappa_settings.json` file include the following:

```js
{
  "lambda_handler": "module.path.to.lambda_handler"
}
```

Where `module-path.to.lambda_handler` is the Python module path to the `lambda_handler` you created above. For example, if you put it in `myproject/__init__.py` the path would be `myproject.lambda_handler`.
